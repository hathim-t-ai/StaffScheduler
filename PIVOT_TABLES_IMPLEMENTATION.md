# Pivot Tables Implementation for Staff Scheduler Analytics

## Overview

Two hierarchical pivot tables have been successfully implemented for the Analytics page as requested:

1. **Staff Analytics Pivot Table** - Multi-view hierarchical drilling with toggle controls:
   - **Country View**: Country → City → Department → Staff
   - **Department View**: Department → Country → City → Staff
2. **Partner Analytics Pivot Table** - Hierarchical drilling: Partner → Projects

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core Components Created

#### `src/components/analytics/HierarchicalPivotTable.tsx`
- Reusable hierarchical table component with drill-down functionality
- Supports expand/collapse with arrow indicators
- Maintains consistent styling with existing Analytics page components
- Handles empty data gracefully
- Configurable columns with custom formatting

#### `src/components/analytics/StaffAnalyticsPivotTable.tsx`
- Staff-specific pivot table implementation with view mode toggle
- **View Mode Toggle**: Toggle buttons for 'Country' and 'Department' views
- **Hierarchical Structures**:
  - **Country View**: Country → City → Department → Staff
  - **Department View**: Department → Country → City → Staff
- **Metrics Displayed**:
  - Total Productive Hrs
  - Total Working Hrs  
  - Chargeability %
  - Budget Consumed
- **Data Aggregation**: Metrics are properly aggregated at each level for both view modes
- **Interactive Controls**: Toggle buttons with highlighted selection state

#### `src/components/analytics/PartnerAnalyticsPivotTable.tsx`
- Partner-specific pivot table implementation
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Partner → Projects
- **Metrics Displayed**:
  - Total Budget
  - Budget Consumed
  - Total Working Hrs Assigned
- **Data Aggregation**: Metrics are properly aggregated at partner level

### 2. Analytics Page Integration

The pivot tables have been integrated into the Analytics page (`src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`):
- Positioned below the 'Chargeability % Heat-map' and 'Budget Consumed (Absolute & %)' visualizations
- Side-by-side layout (Staff table on left, Partner table on right)
- Respects timeframe filters (weekly, monthly, overall)
- Maintains consistent styling with existing components

### 3. PRD Documentation Updated

Added comprehensive requirements to `staff-scheduling-prd.md`:
- **ST-406**: Staff analytics hierarchical pivot table requirements
- **ST-407**: Partner analytics hierarchical pivot table requirements

## Features Implemented

### Staff Analytics Pivot Table Features

✅ Consistent styling with Analytics page filter buttons  
✅ Timeframe filter integration  
✅ View mode selection persistence during session  
✅ Sub-second performance when switching between view modes  

### Partner Analytics Pivot Table Features

✅ Material-UI components for consistency  
✅ Memoized calculations for performance  
✅ Proper data aggregation algorithms  
✅ Expand/collapse state persistence during session  
✅ Responsive design  

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have staff members with varying countries, cities, and departments
2. Ensure you have projects with different partners
3. Ensure you have schedule tasks assigned to staff for projects

### Testing Staff Analytics Pivot Table

1. **Navigate to Analytics Page**
   - Go to the Analytics page in your application
   - Look for the "Staff Analytics Breakdown" table on the left side below the heat-map

2. **Test View Mode Toggle**
   - Locate the toggle buttons labeled 'Country' and 'Department' at the top of the table
   - Verify 'Country' is selected (highlighted) by default
   - Click 'Department' button and verify it becomes highlighted while 'Country' is deselected
   - Click 'Country' button to switch back and verify the selection state changes

2a. **Test Button Styling**
   - Verify both buttons have consistent sizing (approximately 80px minimum width, 36px height)
   - Check that buttons have rounded corners (8px border radius)
   - Confirm selected button has green background (#10b981) with white text
   - Confirm unselected button has white background with dark gray text
   - Test hover states work correctly (light gray hover for unselected, darker green for selected)
   - Verify buttons match the styling of other filter buttons in the Analytics page

3. **Test Country View Hierarchy**
   - Ensure 'Country' view is selected
   - Click the arrow icon next to a country name to expand
   - Verify cities appear under the expanded country
   - Click a city arrow to expand and see departments
   - Click a department arrow to expand and see individual staff

4. **Test Department View Hierarchy**
   - Switch to 'Department' view using the toggle
   - Click the arrow icon next to a department name to expand
   - Verify countries appear under the expanded department
   - Click a country arrow to expand and see cities (for that department)
   - Click a city arrow to expand and see individual staff

5. **Verify Data Aggregation**
   - **Country View**: Check that country-level metrics are the sum of all staff in that country
   - **Department View**: Check that department-level metrics are the sum of all staff in that department
   - Verify that the same staff member appears in both views with identical individual metrics
   - Confirm aggregated totals match across both view modes

6. **Test Performance and State**
   - Switch between view modes multiple times and verify sub-second response
   - Expand some nodes, switch view modes, then switch back to verify collapse state is reset
   - Verify view mode selection persists when navigating within the page but resets on page refresh

7. **Test Timeframe Filters**
   - Change timeframe from "Overall" to "Weekly" or "Monthly"
   - Verify that both view modes update their data accordingly
   - Check that metrics reflect the selected time period in both hierarchies
