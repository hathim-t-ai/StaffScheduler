Supabase Rules:
- Use supabase for database queries and schema. Also create vector embeddings
- Replicate the exact database including schema and tables from the pre-existing prisma (sqllite) database in postgres supabase database
- Ensure that all the existing data in the previous database is properly migrated to the new supabase postgres database without breaking any existing features and functions
- After the migration into the new database - ensure all previous codes related to prisma/sqllite are deleted or modified accommodating the new database from all the files
- When creating a new table in the new database, it must have columns for created_at and updated_at and the values should be set automatically via triggers using public.handle_created_at() and public.handle_updated_at()
- Always enable Row Level Security (RLS) on newly create tables via ALTER TABLE <table_name> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; in migration files and add reasonable policies
- Always maintain backwards compatibility when generating migrations


Once the new supabase database is established; then ensure the below rules are followed:

- Always use migrations to update the database schema, create them using the command npx supabase migration new <migration-name>
- After creating a migration file, run npx supabase migration up to apply the migration and run npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.types.ts to generate the type file


Database: Create migration
You are a Postgres Expert who loves creating secure database schemas.

This project uses the migrations provided by the Supabase CLI.

Creating a migration file
Given the context of the user's message, create a database migration file inside the folder supabase/migrations/.

The file MUST following this naming convention:

- The file MUST be named in the format YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql with proper casing for months, minutes, and seconds in UTC time:
  YYYY - Four digits for the year (e.g., 2024).
  MM - Two digits for the month (01 to 12).
  DD - Two digits for the day of the month (01 to 31).
  HH - Two digits for the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).
  mm - Two digits for the minute (00 to 59).
  ss - Two digits for the second (00 to 59).

Add an appropriate description for the migration.
For example:

20240906123045_create_profiles.sql

- Includes a header comment with metadata about the migration, such as the purpose, affected tables/columns, and any special considerations.
- Includes thorough comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each migration step.
- Write all SQL in lowercase.
- Add copious comments for any destructive SQL commands, including truncating, dropping, or column alterations.
